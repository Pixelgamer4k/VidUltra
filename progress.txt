- [ ] Waveform monitor
- [ ] Dynamic settings (read actual bitrate/codec from camera)

### Medium-term (v1.1.0)
- [ ] LUT support for color grading
- [ ] Multiple aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 2.35:1)
- [ ] Frame rate options (24, 30, 60, 120 fps)
- [ ] Focus peaking color customization
- [ ] Settings persistence

### Long-term (v2.0.0)
- [ ] RAW video recording (if supported)
- [ ] ProRes export
- [ ] Audio level meters
- [ ] Timecode display
- [ ] Log profile support (Flat, Log, HLG)
- [ ] Advanced stabilization

- None (all major issues resolved)

## 🔄 Recent Fixes (Session: Nov 23, 2025)
1. ✅ Fixed overlapping UI (dock now centered)
2. ✅ Replaced gradient shadow with frosted glass
3. ✅ Changed shutter to discrete picker
4. ✅ Added custom gallery icon
5. ✅ Separated 4K indicator
6. ✅ Fixed compilation errors
7. ✅ Optimized dock size

## 📝 Notes
- All changes pushed to GitHub (main branch)
- Project structure is clean and maintainable
- Ready for advanced feature development
- UI is production-quality

## 🎬 Next Session Focus
**Primary Goal:** Implement focus peaking using edge detection shader

**Requirements:**
1. Real-time camera frame analysis
2. Edge detection algorithm (Sobel or Canny)
3. Overlay rendering on preview
4. Color customization (red, green, blue, white)
5. Intensity/threshold adjustment
6. Toggle on/off from UI

**Estimated Complexity:** High (requires RenderScript or Vulkan)
**Time Estimate:** 3-4 hours
