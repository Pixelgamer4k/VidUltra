### Objective
"Nuclear Option": Delete everything and rebuild based on FreeDcam core logic + Modern UI.

### Actions Taken
1.  **Cleanup**: Deleted all project files except journals.
2.  **Rebuild**:
    -   **Project**: Fresh Gradle setup.
    -   **Core**: `Camera2Api.kt` - A robust, singleton-style Camera2 wrapper. Features explicit state management (`Closed`, `Opening`, `Preview`, `Recording`) and dedicated background thread.
    -   **UI**: `CameraScreen.kt` - Jetpack Compose with "Frosted Glass" overlays.
    -   **Bridge**: `CameraViewModel.kt` - Connects UI to Core.

### Rationale
The previous codebase suffered from lifecycle race conditions due to tight coupling between Compose and Camera2. The new architecture separates them completely:
-   **Core** lives in `ViewModel` scope (survives rotation).
-   **UI** just renders the `Surface` and buttons.
-   **Surface** lifecycle drives the `openCamera` call via `SurfaceHolder.Callback`.

### Outcome
A clean, professional-grade codebase ready for testing.
